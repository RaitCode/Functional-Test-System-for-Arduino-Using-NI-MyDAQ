# Functional-Test-System-for-Arduino-Using-NI-MyDAQ  
Arduino board testing  

**Project Overview**
This project demonstrates my ability to integrate an Arduino Uno with NI MyDAQ hardware, automated through LabVIEW, to perform sequential electronic validation tests of Arduino Microcontroller board.  
It showcases a complete and realistic test sequence involving:  
â€¢	Power Rail Integrity Testing (5V and 3.3V)  
â€¢	Digital I/O Communication and Response Time Measurement  
â€¢	PWM Signal Generation and Monitoring  
â€¢	Serial Communication Validation  
All communication between LabVIEW, NI MyDAQ, and Arduino was successfully achieved, overcoming multiple hardware and software challenges.  

**Project Description**  
The system automatically performs the following tests in sequence:  

1.	Power Integrity Test (5V and 3.3V Rails)  
  o	5V Rail Test:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	The Arduinoâ€™s 5V rail is measured using NI MyDAQ Analog Input AI0.  
  o	3.3V Rail Test:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	The Arduinoâ€™s 3.3V rail is measured using NI MyDAQ Analog Input AI1.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	A 5V relay module is used to connect/disconnect the 3.3V line:  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	The 3.3V line is connected to the Normally Open (NO) contact of the relay.  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	During the 3.3V rail test, Arduino closes the relay (writing HIGH to the relay control).  
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	After the 3.3V rail test, Arduino opens the relay (writing LOW) to disconnect the 3.3V rail, freeing AI1 for the PWM tests.  
o	Noise Reduction:  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ï‚§	A capacitor was connected across the AI1 positive and negative terminals of NI myDAQ to stabilize readings during analog measurements.  

*2.	Digital I/O Test*  
  o	LabVIEW (via NI MyDAQ) sends a digital pulse to the Arduino.  
  o	Arduino detects the incoming pulse and sends a return pulse back to MyDAQ.  
  o	The response time between sending and receiving the pulse is measured.  
  o	Arduinoâ€™s onboard LED provides a visual confirmation during this test.  

3.	PWM Signal Testing  
  o	Arduino generates PWM signals with duty cycles of:  
    ï‚§	30%  
    ï‚§	60%  
    ï‚§	90%  
  o	These PWM signals are monitored through NI MyDAQ Analog Input AI1 (after the 3.3V rail is disconnected).  

4.	Serial Communication Test  
  o	LabVIEW sends a 19-character string via serial communication to Arduino.  
  o	Arduino reads and echoes the string back to confirm serial communication reliability.  


**LabVIEW Design Techniques**  
The LabVIEW program integrates several advanced programming techniques to ensure maintainability, modularity, and scalability:  
â€¢Event-Driven State Machine (EDSM) architecture  
â€¢Use of SubVIs for modular code structure  
â€¢Queues for efficient inter-process communication  
â€¢Type Definitions (TypeDefs) to ensure consistent data types across the application  
These techniques demonstrate solid software engineering practices and ensure the test system is responsive and easy to extend.  

**Hardware Used**  
  â€¢	Arduino Uno  
  â€¢	NI MyDAQ  
  â€¢	Jumper wires  
  â€¢	5V Relay Module (for rail switching)  
  â€¢	Capacitor (across AI1 terminals to improve analog signal stability)  
  â€¢	Laptop running LabVIEW 2019 or later  
  
**Software Used**  
â€¢	LabVIEW (for test automation and NI MyDAQ control)  
â€¢	Arduino IDE (for firmware development)  

**Key Challenges Overcome**  
  â€¢	Shared Analog Channel Management:  
  Designed a switching system using a relay to allow AI1 to serve both the 3.3V rail measurement and PWM capture without conflict.  
  â€¢	Reliable Serial Communication Handling:  
  Ensured that serial transmission and echo were properly synchronized without disrupting the test flow.  
  â€¢	Precise Digital I/O Response Measurement:  
  Implemented a mechanism to accurately measure response times between Arduino and LabVIEW.  
  â€¢	State Machine Logic:  
  Built a robust Labview state machine to correctly sequence the tests and synchronize LabVIEW triggers and readings with Arduino.  
  â€¢	Hardware Integration:  
  Successfully interfaced NI MyDAQ's analog and digital capabilities with Arduino's logic and voltage levels.  
  â€¢	Noise Minimization:  
  Added a capacitor across AI1 terminals to reduce measurement noise during analog readings.
